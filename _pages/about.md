Hi there! My name is Wenfan Wu. I am a seasoned ocean modeller and an enthusiastic amateur programmer based in China. My research is primarily focused on investigating nearshore ocean dynamics and biogeochemical processes with numerical ocean models like SCHISM and ROMS. I earned my PhD from Ocean University of China in the summer of 2024. Throughout my doctoral studies, I conducted several intriguing research projects on the waters adjacent to China. These studies provided me with a robust foundation in nearshore biogeochemical knowledge and enhanced my modeling expertise. You can view a list of my peer-reviewed publications on this website. In addition to my research, I developed several practical tools using MATLAB, designed to aid in learning the SCHISM ocean model.
