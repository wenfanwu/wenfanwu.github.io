Hi there! My name is Wenfan Wu (吴文凡). I am an experienced ocean modeler and passionate amateur programmer from China. My research focuses on nearshore ocean dynamics and biogeochemical processes, utilizing advanced numerical ocean models (e.g., SCHISM).

I earned my PhD from Ocean University of China in the summer of 2024. During my doctoral studies, I undertook several fascinating research projects on the waters surrounding China. These experiences not only deepened my expertise in nearshore biogeochemical processes but also honed my skills in ocean modeling. Currently, I am engaged in the development of [Chesapeake Bay Program's Phase 7 Water Quality Model](https://www.chesapeakebay.net/what/programs/modeling/phase-7-model-development) with SCHISM developers' team. 

In addition to my research, I have developed a suite of practical MATLAB tools aimed at facilitating the learning and application of the SCHISM ocean model.
