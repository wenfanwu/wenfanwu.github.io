1. __[Miller, C. B., & Wheeler, P. A. (2012). *Biological oceanography*. John Wiley & Sons.](https://bcs.wiley.com/he-bcs/Books?action=index&bcsId=7242&itemId=144433302X)__
   
   This book will teach you quite comprehensive knowledges about the biological oceanography, from plankton food web to fishery oceanography. There are also some basic knowledge about BGC modeling in it. This book is more like a professional textbook. and it also has a [Chinese version](https://www.sohu.com/a/415950849_100013296) published by the Sun-Yat-Sen University Press. 

2. __[Simpson, J. H., & Sharples, J. (2012). *Introduction to the physical and biological oceanography of shelf seas*. Cambridge University Press.](https://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9781139034098)__ 
   This book is specially written for physical oceangraphyers, focusing on nearshore processes. It invovles multiple aspects about the interactions of physical and biological processes. 

3. __[Mann, K. H., & Lazier, J. R. (2005). *Dynamics of marine ecosystems: biological-physical interactions in the oceans*. John Wiley & Sons.](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/book/10.1002/9781118687901)__
   This classic book is similiar to Simpson and Sharples (2012), involving special knowledge about physical-biological oceanography

4. __[Justic, D., Rose, K. A., Hetland, R. D., & Fennel, K. (Eds.). (2017). *Modeling coastal hypoxia: Numerical simulations of patterns, controls and effects of dissolved oxygen dynamics*. Springer International Publishing.](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-319-54571-4)__
   This book is specially designed for biogeochemical modeling, and it is more like a collection of BGC modeling cases in different regions around the world. 

5. __[Glibert, P. M., Berdalet, E., Burford, M. A., Pitcher, G. C., & Zhou, M. (Eds.). (2018). *Global ecology and oceanography of harmful algal blooms* (Vol. 232). Cham: Springer.](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-319-70069-4)__
   This book contains a myriad of case studies about HABs all across the globe, of which the major content originates from the GEOHAB programme.
